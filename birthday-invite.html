<h3>News:</h3>
<p>
  I am continuing to work with HR on staffing opportunities you. To open up additional options, I would like to get you submitted for ICE clearance. Could you please let me know if you have any concerns with us submitting you for clearance?Â  If you are willing, I will have Nate reach out to get the process initiated. That way we can consider you for ICE options as new task orders are awarded in the coming weeks.
